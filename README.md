# HubGrep

<img src="hubgrep/static/images/screenshot_hubgrep.png" height="300">

Search for code repositories over many code-hosting services at once. 

This means you don't have to mentally filter non-repo results as in regular search engines, but perhaps more importantly, 
one service does not get prioritized over another in non-transparent ways - they're all equal to one another with HubGrep.

Alpha version - expect breaking changes!

Try it out on [hubgrep.io](https://hubgrep.io/)!
