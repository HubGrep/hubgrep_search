# HubGrep

![screenshot of hubgrep](hubgrep/static/images/hubgrep_screenshot.png)


Search for code repositories over many code-hosting services at once. 

This means you don't have to mentally filter non-repo results in view, but perhaps more importantly, 
one service does not get prioritized over another in non-transparent ways - they're all equal to one another with HubGrep.

You can find the Supported services, documentation for deployments and development setup over at the [docs](https://docs.hubgrep.io/en/latest/)
